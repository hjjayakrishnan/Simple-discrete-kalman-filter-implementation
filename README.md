Simple-discrete-kalman-filter-implementation
============================================
This is a simple implementation of a discrete kalman filter to a system which is trying to sense the voltage of a source. The sensor readings are erroneous and the discrete kalman filter is used to filter out the noise. This is the most basic implementation (1-Dimensional) and I'll be adding more advanced implementations soon.
